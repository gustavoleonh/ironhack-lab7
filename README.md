### Design Challenges:

*Global Configuration Management: Design a system that ensures a single, globally accessible configuration object without access conflicts.
**Dynamic Object Creation Based on User Input: Implement a system to dynamically create various types of user interface elements based on user actions.
***State Change Notification Across System Components: Ensure components are notified about changes in the state of other parts without creating tight coupling.
****Efficient Management of Asynchronous Operations: Manage multiple asynchronous operations like API calls which need to be coordinated without blocking the main application workflow.
